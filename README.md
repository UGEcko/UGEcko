- 👋 Hi, I’m @UGEcko
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in Beat Saber Mapping(Noodle Extensions Maps)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Noodle Extensions
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Beat Saber Maps in the future
- 
- 📫 How to reach me | Discord: UG-Ecko#5794


- Im making a Full BeatSaber mapping tutorial project, this includes the basics and feature use to chromapper (An awesome FREE mapper for beatsaber), and map making including the song, setting it up, and publishing it.

- Since I mentioned my learning into Noodle Extensions, I plan on making a tutorial on that aswell. (This may take some time as I am still very new to NE.)

* The project is already published, but it doesnt have anything linked to it. Im planning on releasing the full project from early March to late april. (This gives me time to perfect everything in the project, this project has 6 repos default, so it will take me time to perfect and word everything to my liking to KNOW that players will learn off of this.

Thank you! See ya!
